jsonrpc Request Format:
=======================

The fields–‘jsonrpc’, ‘method’, ‘params’, and ‘id’ are all required by the JSON-RPC specification. 
These fields specify the version (jsonrpc 2.0), a remote action (the ‘method’), the arguments to send (the ‘params’), 
and an identifier so you can match the request to the response.

For Arista, the ‘method’ is always ‘runCmds’.  
This is the method that will be executed on the Arista switch.  
The ‘params’ field contains a set of subfields including ‘version’ (which is currently always set to 1) and ‘cmds’.  
The ‘cmds’ subfield specifies the commands to run on the switch. This is set to [“show version”] above.  
Note, the ‘cmds’ subfield is an array of commands (i.e. you can specify multiple commands here).

  "params": {
    "version": 1,
